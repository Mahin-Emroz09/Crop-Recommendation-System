# Introduction
This project is a crop recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to provide farmers with recommendations on the most suitable crops to grow based on environmental and soil conditions.
# Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahin-Emroz09/Crop-Recommendation-System.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd crop_recommendation_system
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook crop_recommendation_system_which_is_helpful_for_farmers.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `Crop_recommendation.csv`. It contains various features such as soil conditions, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters.

## Model Training

The notebook includes code for training a machine learning model using the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Training (using algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)
4. Model Evaluation

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation are displayed within the notebook, including classification reports and performance metrics.
